# metaquestion
metaquestion_title: Metafragen
metaquestion_description: >
  Eine Metafrage ist eine Frage über eine Frage, wie beispielsweise „Darf ich etwas fragen?“
  oder „Kennt sich jemand mit Computern aus?“.

  In der Regel wird der Begriff Metafrage aber verallgemeinert und für alle Fragen verwendet,
  die keine direkte Frage zum Problem des Hilfesuchenden sind. Der Hilfesuchende fragt also zunächst
  allgemein, ob jemand helfen kann. Gerade Neulinge oder unerfahrene Benutzer lassen sich zu Metafragen
  hinreißen, um einen kompetenten und hilfsbereiten Ansprechpartner zu finden. Meistens werden Metafragen
  ignoriert oder der Fragende wird rüde darauf hingewiesen, dass ihm niemand bei seinem Problem
  helfen könne, ohne dies zu kennen. Grundsätzlich folgt auf eine Meta-Frage eine weitere Frage.
requested_by: Requested by @{} ({})
metaquestion_description_reduced: "http://metafrage.de/ (Requested by {})"
mq_advantages_title: Vorteile von Metafragen
mq_advantages:
  - als höfliche Floskel um Aufmerksamkeit zu gewinnen
  - Beginn einer zunächst einseitigen Konversation (Allgemeine Problemanalyse)
mq_disadvantages_title: Nachteile von Metafragen
mq_disadvantages:
  - >-
    die Anwesenden könnten eventuell bei dem Problem helfen, obwohl sie (eventuell aus Bescheidenheit)
    nicht von sich behaupten würden, mit dem Thema vertraut zu sein,
  - >-
    oft ist die Metafrage falsch formuliert, z. B. wird gefragt „kennt sich jemand mit Kochen aus?“
    und er will nur wissen, ob Mangos essbar sind,
  - >-
    Auch wenn jemand mit dem erfragten Thema vertraut ist, bedeutet dies nicht, dass er eine
    spezielle Frage zu diesem beantworten kann – niemand ist allwissend,
  - >-
    wenn keine Reaktion auf die Metafrage erfolgt, beläßt es der Fragende meist dabei. So
    kann eine Antwort auf das Problem von später Aufmerksamwerdenden nicht erfolgen.
